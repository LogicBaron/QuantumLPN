# QuantumLPN
A Project for Simulation of Quantum LPN solver.

Reference Paper :
  


These codes are written in matlab.
Basically, you can use lpn.mat or lpn_parpool.mat for your simulation.


At the point of your code execution, you can set several arguments including mode "history" or "reinforcement".

lpn_history.mat and lpn_reinforcement.mat file will executed according to your mode choice.

More details of Simulation settings and problem is stated in the paper.
